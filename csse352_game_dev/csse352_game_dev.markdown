<h2>Course Management</h2>
<h4>Course Objectives</h4>

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Describe** the basic requirements that define a genetic conflict system.
2. **Identify** the differences between genetic conflict systems.
3. **Explain** how these systems might arise.
4. **Explain** what kind of 'defense systems' genomes develop to deal with these conflicts.
5. **Analyze** experiments designed to interrogate these conflict systems.

<h4>Texts</h4>

Most of the reading for this course will be peer-reviewed journal articles. But for a reference I recommend:

1. Burt, A & Trivers, R. (2008) Genes in Conflict: The Biology of Selfish Genetic Elements. *Belknap Press*
 * This is a great overview of conflict theory and systems.

1. Freeman, S., & Herron, J. C. (2007). *Evolutionary analysis 5th ed.* 
 * This is a good general overview of evolutionary theory and is a good source for review if you need it.

1. Other readings will be provided on moodle, teams, or as a link here. Usually these will be peer-reviewed articles, with occasional other sources attached.

<h5>Reading effectively</h5>

The reference books should be used to help fill in gaps in your knowledge and understanding, or reinforce ideas we discuss in class. Reading it is not strictly necessary, but encouraged. 

Other assigned readings provided on moodle will be assumed knowledge for our discussions in class, you should come prepared to discuss these and have questions about them ready each day. These readings might evolve over the course of the quarter to better reflect the interests of the class. You should regularly check the course schedule to ensure you are not missing any key readings.

<h2>Assessments</h2>

<h5>Tokens</h5>

Each student begins the quarter with <u>two tokens</u>, these are a second chance opportunity. They can be used on any assignment, submission, or activity throughout the quarter. If you are using a token you are expected to inform me within 2 days of the associated assessment item's normal due date (unless otherwise specified). 

You will have several opportunities to gain tokens throughout the quarter. These might be grant for excellent participation, very good performance, or particularly insightful discussion. Robert will inform you of some opportunities to explicitly gain these tokens, but may grant them unannounced. Every interaction and submission should be considered an opportunity to use and gain tokens. 

If you end the quarter with at least 2 tokens your final letter grade will receive a half letter-grade boost. 

<h5>Weekly Analyses</h5>

*Description*

Each Friday, you will receive by email a question relating to course material. You will submit a response to this question by Tuesday at 5pm on Gradescope. I will return your submission to you before the next analysis is assigned. The question will almost certainly require outside reading or information acquisition; it will definitely require you to practice thinking in the higher levels of [Bloom's taxonomy](https://www.teachthought.com/learning/what-is-blooms-taxonomy-a-definition-for-teachers/). Submissions will be scored as per the attached guidelines, using a specifications grading approach. See me in office for clarification of scores or comments. *You should indicate how long you spent working on the WA at the top of each submission.*

You should consider these analyses as a miniature research paper, it should follow the same structure and logic as peer-reviewed articles. [This guide from Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/11-steps-to-structuring-a-science-paper-editors-will-take-seriously) has some suggestions for organizing and writing journal articles you may want to look over. This is an advanced course and your submissions for these assignments should reflect your expertise as an upper-year expert in life sciences.

*Grading*

The weekly analysis submissions will be scored using an approach called specifications grading. The specifications are listed below. To earn credit for a submission, all specifications must be met. Some commentary will be provided, although you may always consult me for guidance on improvement or different approaches. During the course of the class, you may re-submit via email a weekly analysis answer, within one week, with the original version included (in the same file as your revised answer) and indicating that you are cashing in a token. 

I will distribute at least 12 weekly analysis questions (at least one per week) with some weeks having two or even three questions that can be answered. Note that you are being given many more opportunities to pass assignments than you strictly need in order to get an A in the course. In this way, you will be able to best regulate your effort and focus on topics of particular interest to you. 

*Grading scale*

* 6 passing submissions          40%

* 5 passing submissions          33%

* 4 passing submissions            27%

* 3 passing submissions           20%

* 2 or fewer passing submissions   0%


 *Specifications for a passing submission*

* Incorporates concepts from class.

* Takes a position.

* Supports arguments with data or logic.

* Identifies constraints, limitations, or alternate perspectives.

* Represents a complete, organized, logical response.

* Demonstrates Bloom's taxonomy levels of analysis, synthesis, or evaluation.

* Incorporates the primary or secondary literature external to that examined in class.

* Is professional in the communication approach, including grammatical and language choices.

* Follows the course submission guidelines. [see the Course Administrative Info section below]

<h5>In-Class Participation</h5>

You are expected to participate in discussions, activities, and some group work as part of class. This grade will reflect your participation in our live Teams meetings as well as participation through discussion in the Teams group. 

<h5>Conflict Minute</h5>

Each week you will be expected to do independent learning and research on relevant course topics. You are expected to find a relevant peer-reviewed piece of research, read it, and write a brief summary along with reflection on how it ties into the course topics. The papers you read should have been published no more than three years ago. (Though I would make exceptions for important classic papers if you okay it with me first.)

You will post a link (preferably as a DOI link, not a gross library link, please) to the paper, and your write-up on the class Teams Group in the "Conflict Minute" section. 

You are expected to review everyone's posts, and to **meaningfully** engage with at least 2 other posts each week. You might ask a question in some one's post, or pose an alternative interpretation of the data, or post a follow-up paper that is relevant. You must demonstrate a depth of thinking about the post in your engagement, a surface level question about the paper is not sufficient. 

The cut-off for your contribution will be 5pm on Friday each week and 10am on Monday each week for your responses to your peer's posts. If you have not met the requirements for engagement with these posts for the week I will let you know by Monday morning. *The grade for the evolution minute is all or nothing*, if you fully participate each week you get the full credit, if you do not you get no credit.

<h5>Final Project</h5>
Your final project for this course will be to boil down a genetic conflict system of your choice to it's core elements and explain it to a non-expert audience. You will be using a board game as the medium to explain the system you have chosen. The rules of the game and dynamics the players participate in must demonstrate the mechanisms that drive the conflict.

This project will be done in groups of 2-3 students and have various artifacts you'll need to produce, described below. For some inspiration you might consider looking at [Peptide: A Protein Building Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/166298/peptide-protein-building-game). Robert is also always happy to geek out about other board games or related media. 

You'll be drafting these artifacts over a series of milestones during the quarter ([M1](BIO491_conflict/M1) [M2](BIO491_conflict/M2) [M3](BIO491_conflict/M3)). After you have a team [you should follow this link](https://classroom.github.com/g/lYVHKPZM) to set up your repository for documents. Robert will give a brief git tutorial for how to use this.

<h4>Game Documents (50%)</h4>
You will need to produce all the materials needed to learn, play, and teach your game. The language and formatting of these documents should be professional. The exact types of documents you will need to produce will depend on the game you design, but you will definitely need an instruction manual and may need to produce some cards, boards, etc. If you have specific material needs talk to Robert and we'll see what we can do. 

Remember, these documents are how you will be explaining your conflict system to a non-expert audience.

<h4>Analysis Presentation (30%)</h4>
You will give a 20 minute presentation on how the mechanics of your game demonstrate the important dynamics of the conflict system you have chosen. 

Your presentation should minimally touch on these points:
 * What is scientifically known about the conflict system you have chosen?
 * What is unknown about this (or similar) systems?
 * How does your game demonstrate key features of this system?
 * In what ways is your game misrepresenting parts of the system?
 * Justify any simplifications or modifications of the dynamics you made for the game.

This presentation does not need to explain every rule of the game or how to play it. It should focus on the scientific ideas that inspire the game. This presentation should be aimed at an expert scientific audience. 

<h4>Video Introduction (10%)</h4>
You will need to record a video introduction to your game. These should be no longer than 15 minutes, they should explain the core rules of the game, and touch on the scientific relevance of the dynamics demonstrated by the game. As an example of one such video, [here is a brief review of Peptide](https://youtu.be/p_K4pRfChfc?t=63). This video focuses more on the mechanics of the game than the science, but is meant as a general guide.

<h4>Player Reviews (10%)</h4>
During week 10 we will have a play session of the games in our classroom. You will be expected to watch the videos of all the other groups games and will play at least 2 of these games. You will write a review of the games you play. Your review will reflect both on the game itself and its ability to communicate scientific ideas to players. Your final grade on the project will depend on how your peers rate your game. In order to get these points you need to submit valid reviews of at least 2 other games.

<h5>Overall Grading</h5>

Project 35%

In-class participation 15%

Evolution minute 10%

Weekly analyses 40%

<h2>Course Administrative Info</h2>

<h4>Formatting guidelines</h4>

Assignments will be submitted and returned via gradescope, the link and instructions for our gradescope page can be found on moodle. In general, assignments should be submitted as a pdf, in 12 point Arial font, they should always include your name and CM# on the first page. Note that WAs should include an estimate of the total amount of time spent working on them. 

<h4>Class attendance</h4>
This class will be highly interactive, I expect you to have read and assigned material before class and come prepared to discuss, ask questions, and think deeply about the topics of the day. I will record our sessions over Teams for your review later if you need them, or if for some reason you cannot make a meeting. This should not be your regular plan for gathering course material, if you do not sufficiently participate in course discussion or miss too many live meetings you will receive a failing grade for the course. 

<h4>Collaboration</h4>

Collaboration is a key part of the scientific process, therefore collaboration is encouraged on homework, quizzes, and laboratories.  When you collaborate, you must properly credit your collaborators and clearly indicate the extent of the collaboration. In all cases, each individual is responsible for understanding and writing out the entire solution. For example, on weekly analyses, this means that once a group solution has been achieved, each collaborator must rework the problem and write up the solution independently. Copying is not collaboration.

Peer-review of each other's work is also highly encouraged. If you review another person's work (e.g. a WA submission) and it leads to substantive changes that may earn you a token, both parties involved in the review should indicate to Robert that this happened. Robert may ask for evidence of improvement (e.g. a document with tracked changes/comments from the review). 

Any kind of plagiarism or cheating will result in a severe penalty in the course and Student Affairs will be notified. See [this page](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/registrar/rules-and-procedures/discipline-and-suspension.html) for details.

Most importantly, any actions that reduce your ability or your opportunity to learn can be considered academic misconduct. Make sure you learn!

<h4>Concerns or Feedback</h4>

I strongly encourage students to document special academic needs with staff at the Office of Student Affairs and/or the Counseling Center, and then to contact me as soon as possible so that we can work together to provide recommended academic accommodations while protecting your privacy.

If you have any concerns about any course matters, you should tell someone. You can email your instructor, speak to your instructor, or leave anonymous feedback in Moodle. You can also contact the [department head](mailto:ahmed@rose-hulman.edu), [Student Affairs](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-affairs/index.html), or another Rose employee you feel comfortable with.

While you are more than welcome to consult any member of our department if you have concerns, we realize it's helpful to have a few names to start with. If you have a concern and are not sure where to go, the following CSSE faculty have volunteered to be help out with any concerns you may have: Amanda Stouder (F222) and Kim Tracy (D216) or appropriate BIO faculty.

This syllabus is subject to revision with prompt notification of enrolled students.
