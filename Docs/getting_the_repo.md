# How to Clone the CSSE220 Repo

All the materials for CSSE220 are stored in [the course git
repo](https://github.com/hewner/csse220).  To access code examples and homework, you'll want to
use Eclipse to clone (that is, copy) the repo onto your local system.

1. Start Eclipse

2. Go to "File > Import" in the menu

3. Select "Git > Projects From Git" from the folder list  and click "Next" 

4. Select "Clone URI"

5. Put https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse220.git in the URI field and click "Next"

6. Make sure master is checked and click "Next"

7. You can choose any directory you like as your destination.  You'll
   be able to use this directory to access a local copy of all the
   slides and other 220 materials, so pick something you'll remember.
   
   Choose one and click "Next"

8. It'll be a bit while the repo downloads.

   Make sure the radio button selects "Import existing Eclipse
   projects" and click "Next"

9. Click "Deselect all" unless you want to spam you project list with a million projects.

   Find the project JavaIntro by typing it into the project search
   box. Check the box next to "JavaIntro" and click "Finish".

10. If you see a folder labeled "JavaIntro" in the left pane it worked!

# How to Get Another Project From the Downloaded Repo

Very similar to the steps above, except:

* For step 4, instead say "Existing Local Repository"
* For step 5, select your already downloaded repo and click "Next"
* For step 9, use the search bar to find what you want (don't forget the deselect)

*Important* We update the course over the term.  To ensure you've
gotten the latest version, right click on your newly downloaded repo,
Select "Team > Pull" - that will pull in any updates we've made to the
repo.
