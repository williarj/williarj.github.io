<h1>
	CSSE 220: Object-Oriented Software Development <br />
	Design Problems
</h1>
<p>
	You will do this exercise by yourself.
</p>
<h2>
	Goals 
</h2>
This exercise will let you practice object oriented design.

<h2>
	Grading rubric 
</h2>
<ul>
	<li> 10 points for each problem (there are 6 total) </li>
	<li> Within an individual problem: 3 points for identifying what we consider the main problem in each flawed
          design.  You may list several flaws, but you won't get full credit unless you identify the main flaw.  This means
          you should look carefully and ensure your examination is exhaustive.  However, you will lose points for flaws
          that are incorrect (i.e. not really in the design).</li>
	<li> Within an individual problem: 4 points for making a good design without flaws and expressing it in correct UML.
</li>

</ul>
Total possible: 60 points.

	Example Problems
</h2>
<p>
Here are a set of four design problems for you to practice on your own. 
In addition, there is a solution with commentary and good designs to compare with the designs you produce on your own.
