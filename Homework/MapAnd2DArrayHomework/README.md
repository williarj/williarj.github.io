# Map and 2D Array Homework

This exercise will let you practice using 2D arrays and hashmaps on a
more challenging set of problems.

You will do this exercise yourself *except* if you like you can find a
partner and collaborate on exactly 1 of the problems.  Note in your
comments which problem you collaborated on and who you collaborated
with.

# Rubric

* Each of the 8 regular problems is worth 10 points.
* The bonus problem is worth 5 extra-credit points

Total possible: 80 points (+5 extra credit).

The problems themselves are already reasonably documented --- don't
worry about writing class/method comments on this program but do keep
your code clean, well formatted, and understandable.
