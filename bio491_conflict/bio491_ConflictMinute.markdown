# Conflict Minute

Each week you will be expected to do independent learning and research on relevant course topics. You are expected to find a relevant peer-reviewed piece of research, read it, and write a brief summary along with reflection on how it ties into the course topics. The papers you read should have been published no more than three years ago. (Though I would make exceptions for important classic papers if you okay it with me first.)

You will post a link (preferably as a DOI link, not a gross library link, please) to the paper, and your write-up on the class Teams Group in the "Conflict Minute" section. 

You are expected to review everyone's posts, and to **meaningfully** engage with at least 2 other posts each week. You might ask a question in some one's post, or pose an alternative interpretation of the data, or post a follow-up paper that is relevant. You must demonstrate a depth of thinking about the post in your engagement, a surface level question about the paper is not sufficient. 

The cut-off for your contribution will be 5pm on Friday each week and 10am on Monday each week for your responses to your peer's posts. If you have not met the requirements for engagement with these posts for the week I will let you know by Monday morning. *The grade for the evolution minute is all or nothing*, if you fully participate each week you get the full credit, if you do not you get no credit.
