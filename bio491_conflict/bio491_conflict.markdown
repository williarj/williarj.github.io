# RHIT BIO491 - The Evolution of Genetic Conflict

## Course Info
### Course Description

What happens when your genome doesn't get along with itself? Different genes, chromosomes, or cells can have competing interests that don't always align, leading to strange traits, behaviors, and sometimes diseases. In this course we will examine different types of genetic conflict, primarily in plant and animal genomes, and investigate the ways in which they arise, are maintained, and removed from populations. Specific topics may include the evolution of transposable elements, gene drive systems, cytoplasmic male sterility, and genetic imprinting. Each week we will talk about a system of conflict starting with relevant theory and then empirical data from a range of taxa. This course is intended for upper year students with an understanding of the basics of evolutionary theory and genetics.

**Prerequisites:** BIO 110 - Cell Structure and Function and (BIO 205 - Cellular Physiology or BIO 210 - Mendelian & Molecular Genetics or BIO 230 - Cell Biology or permission of instructor)

## Schedule

You are assumed to have a working knowledge of basic genetics, natural selection, and DNA replication for this class. If you need a review you should ask for additional sources.

Readings marked with a day number in brackets (e.g. [2]) before the author name indicate the day you must have read these papers before class. If there is no number assume you must read the paper before the earliest associated day. 

Note that the topics listed in this schedule are tentative, and we may move or rearrange them depending on how long each topic takes in class. Due dates and scheduled book discussions will not change. Scheduled guest speakers may be adjusted based on the needs of the speakers.

## Course Management
### Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Describe** the basic requirements that define a genetic conflict system.
2. **Identify** the differences between genetic conflict systems.
3. **Explain** how these systems might arise.
4. **Explain** what kind of 'defense systems' genomes develop to deal with these conflicts.
5. **Analyze** experiments designed to interrogate these conflict systems.

### Texts

We will be reading a popular science book together throughout the quarter, this book is intended to help frame the history of the ideas we discuss in class and to elucidate the scientific discussions around this topic. We will have discussions of each chapter of this book, see the schedule for more details. This book is listed as *GEVE* in the schedule. 

1. √Ögren, JA. (2021) The Gene's-Eye View of Evolution. *Oxford University Press*. 

This book is provided online by the Logan Library at [this link.](https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rose-hulman.edu?url=https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198862260.001.0001) You can read it online or download a pdf.

Most of the other reading for this course will be peer-reviewed journal articles. But for a reference I recommend these books, both of which you can borrow from me:

1. Burt, A & Trivers, R. (2008) Genes in Conflict: The Biology of Selfish Genetic Elements. *Belknap Press*
 * This is a great overview of conflict theory and systems.

1. Freeman, S., & Herron, J. C. (2007). *Evolutionary analysis 5th ed.* 
 * This is a good general overview of evolutionary theory and is a good source for review if you need it.

1. Other readings will be provided on moodle, teams, or as a link here. Usually these will be peer-reviewed articles, with occasional other sources attached.

#### Reading effectively

The reference books should be used to help fill in gaps in your knowledge and understanding, or reinforce ideas we discuss in class. Reading it is not strictly necessary, but encouraged. 

The articles for each day are not required reading, you should use them as a reference when reviewing material. Though if you read these before the assigned day you may be able to engage more directly with the lectures on these topics. 

## Assessments

#### Tokens

Each student begins the quarter with <u>two tokens</u>, these are a second chance opportunity. They can be used on any *individual* assignment, submission, or activity throughout the quarter. If you are using a token you are expected to inform me within 2 days of the associated assessment item's normal due date (unless otherwise specified). 

You will have several opportunities to gain tokens throughout the quarter. These might be grant for excellent participation, very good performance, or particularly insightful discussion. Robert will inform you of some opportunities to explicitly gain these tokens, but may grant them unannounced. Every interaction and submission should be considered an opportunity to use and gain tokens. 

If you end the quarter with at least 2 tokens your final letter grade will receive a half letter-grade boost. 

#### In-Class Participation

You are expected to participate in discussions, activities, and some group work as part of class. This grade will reflect your participation in regular class discussion, and in particular on your contributions during discussions of GEVE.

<!-- removed 2324b [Conflict Minute](ConflictMinute) -->

#### Overall Grading

[Project](/BIO491_conflict/FinalProject) 35%

In-class participation 15%

[Paper Presentation](BIO491_conflict/docs/presentation_rubric.pdf) 10%
<!-- need to convert this to text and flesh out the instructions more -->

[Weekly analyses](/bio491_conflict/WA) 40%

## Course Administrative Info

### Formatting guidelines

Assignments will be submitted and returned via gradescope, the link and instructions for our gradescope page can be found on moodle. In general, assignments should be submitted as a pdf, in 12 point Arial font, they should always include your name on the first page. Note that WAs should include an estimate of the total amount of time spent working on them. 

### Class attendance
This class will be highly interactive, I expect you to come prepared to discuss, ask questions, and think deeply about the topics of the day. If you do not sufficiently participate in course discussion or miss more than 3 live meetings you will receive a failing grade for the course. 

### Collaboration

Collaboration is a key part of the scientific process, therefore collaboration is encouraged on homework, quizzes, and laboratories.  When you collaborate, you must properly credit your collaborators and clearly indicate the extent of the collaboration. In all cases, each individual is responsible for understanding and writing out the entire solution. For example, on weekly analyses, this means that once a group solution has been achieved, each collaborator must rework the problem and write up the solution independently. Copying is not collaboration.

Peer-review of each other's work is also highly encouraged. If you review another person's work (e.g. a WA submission) and it leads to substantive changes that may earn you a token, both parties involved in the review should indicate to Robert that this happened. Robert may ask for evidence of improvement (e.g. a document with tracked changes/comments from the review). 

Any kind of plagiarism or cheating will result in a severe penalty in the course and Student Affairs will be notified. See [this page](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/registrar/rules-and-procedures/discipline-and-suspension.html) for details.

Most importantly, any actions that reduce your ability or your opportunity to learn can be considered academic misconduct. Make sure you learn!

### Concerns or Feedback

I strongly encourage students to document special academic needs with staff at the Office of Student Affairs and/or the Counseling Center, and then to contact me as soon as possible so that we can work together to provide recommended academic accommodations while protecting your privacy.

If you have any concerns about any course matters, you should tell someone. You can email your instructor, speak to your instructor, or leave anonymous feedback in Moodle. You can also contact the [department head](mailto:weiner@rose-hulman.edu), [Student Affairs](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-affairs/index.html), or another Rose employee you feel comfortable with.

This syllabus is subject to revision with prompt notification of enrolled students.
