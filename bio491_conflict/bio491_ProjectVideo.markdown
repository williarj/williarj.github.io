<h1>RHIT BIO491 - Video Introduction</h1>

Your video should be a short introduction giving an overview or the theme and rules of the game. A potential player should be able to watch this and have a general idea of the main flow of the game and what their actions should be.

<h2> Panopto </h2>
You'll upload a video to the Rose-Hulman Panopto server, follow the link here for the main page to log in with your RHIT credentials: [https://rose-hulman.hosted.panopto.com/](https://rose-hulman.hosted.panopto.com/)

If you press the "Create" Button on the left it will give you a list of options. You can download and use the Panopto software for recording, and edit your video in the browser. Or you can record the video and edit it in some other format and upload a completed video with the "Upload Media" button or by dragging and dropping the file into the Panopto browser after opening the correct folder.

You should put the final video in the folder titled "BIO491_2324b [assignments]". When you select the folder to put your video (either when recording through the Panopto software or through the Upload Media button) search for the folder by typing "bio491 [assignments]" then select the appropriate folder from the list. [Here is a link to this folder so you can see the folder name](https://rose-hulman.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%227baa0bb9-3692-4940-9fc4-b10a012fbfc3%22) and verify your upload.
