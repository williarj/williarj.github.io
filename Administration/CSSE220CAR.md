# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PREVIOUS OFFERING AND CORRESPONDING CHANGES

* Continue revisions to the OO-curriculum, try to reduce student frustration with UML
We did this and there was greatly reduced negative feedback from the students about UML.

* Implement the threading piloting officially
We did this, which created more time to allow students to focus on the project, even allowing in-class work time for the project.

* Consider piloting some ideas to make project easier:
  - Reducing the scope slightly and dropping group size to pairs
We did this successfully and the pairing seemed to help greatly in terms of team conflicts.

  - Getting team assignment and initial design happening before Exam 2
We did NOT do this, but based on some feedback from students this could be an appropriate measure to take.
  - Further refining the project related classes to give more timely help on issues students struggle with
Several classes are now devoted to discussing design pattern/problem issues and live-coding an example “game” to the project which provides students an example to learn from.

This year we also: 

1. Changed course materials organization/website (did two different versions)
2. Changed the way assignments are submitted (git)
3. Moved some content earlier in the course (UML/design)
 


# LEARNING OUTCOMES

Students who successfully complete this course should be able to:

1. Develop software that incorporates the following techniques:
   - Inheritance and class hierarchies
   - Interfaces
   - Polymorphism
   - Casting
   - Exceptions
   - Collections
   - Event-driven graphical user interfaces
   - Exploring and using large-scale API packages (e.g. GUI libraries)
   - Recursion
2. Perform the following steps of the software development cycle effectively:
   - Design expressed as UML class diagrams
   - Documentation before coding
   - Unit and system testing
3. Explain the implementation of linked lists
4. Analyze the asymptotic worst case run time of simple programs.
5. Predict the performance of simple algorithms, including search and
   sort, given their asymptotic worst, best, and average case run
   times.  
6. Select basic data structures (i.e., arrays, linked lists) based on
   asymptotic time complexity of typical operations.
7. Work in a team of 2-4 students on a small-to-medium-size software
   development project including at least three iterative development
   cycles, demonstrating effective:
   - Use of team roles
   - Team decision making
   - Division of labor
   - Conflict resolution

# DESCRIPTION OF ASSESSMENT TOOLS 

Written exercises and small programs: Short thought problems,
mathematical analyses, or design exercises.  Students are also asked
to implement a few of the designs.  Written evaluations of team
members.

Programming assignments: Several programming assignments of varying
size and length.

Exams: 2 exams during the term, plus the final exam

Project: A small-to-medium-size software development project including
at least three iterative development cycles done by teams of 2 and occasionally 3
students

## Summary of Relevant student feedback

Overall student feedback remains very positive.  Recurring concerns:



### The course moves too quickly from topic to topic without enough depth

This is always a challenge, but perhaps it could be that by adding additional resources and  optional activities, the students that feel the need for more depth could do this independently.


### The exams were too long or too hard (they sometimes claimed that the homework was not as hard as the exams)

Aside from making exams easier, we could look to add some extra challenges that go above and beyond the current assignments. This could be done purely for the students wanting to push themselves and not necessarily requiring additional grading/workload for TAs.


### Wishing the project were started earlier 
There are frequently a few student concerns with the project, generally:

* There is not enough time to do the project
* The final weeks of the semester are overloaded with work from other classes

We made some revisions this year to actually make things easier with the final project. We gave more in-class time, continued to improve examples and workday materials, and switched to groups of size 2 primarily. 

Other ideas we have moving forward:

* Getting team assignment and initial design happening before Exam 2
* Possibly getting partners setup on an assignment before the project (and a chance for students to switch)

  



### Some students seemed interested in the course being turned into a flipped classroom or online course

Obviously creating a flipped classroom would take a lot of work and might not be a good change for all students. However, if we did provide more materials for students to prepare for class ahead of time and work through activities it might help the students that did express this interest.


### Course topics seeming disconnected (esp. re. project)

We could explore ideas to make some connection between the project and the material covered in the last third of the course. For instance, require a Big-O analysis of the operation of their collision detection, require the use of their own implementation of a linked list somewhere, etc.


### More even distribution or topics/workload throughout the course

The movement of some paper homework design problems created a number of times where multiple assignments overlap and we could look to modify the schedule and assignments to prevent this more. 

### Desire for more resources for help 

Some students might not have been particularly aggressive in seeking out resources and might not have been aware of the resources that were available. Improving the extra resources we have and making sure that they are very easily accessible could definitely help some of the students that struggled but did not get the help they apparently desired.


## Recommendations for the Next Offering

* Getting team assignment and initial design happening before Exam 2
* Possibly getting partners setup on an assignment before the project (and a chance for students to switch)
* Reviewing distribution of assignments to try to better balance the workload, eliminating overlapping assignments as possible
* Improving the quality and accessibility of additional resources for greater depth or preparation
* Finalizing a more sustainable plan for the course website for future instructors to all use
* Releasing the most challenging/recent past exams to help set student expectations
* Try to find ways to require course material presented during the final project to be used in the final project
* Introduce a survey early during the project about the effectiveness of team communication.
