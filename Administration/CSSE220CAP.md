CSSE 220 â€” Object-Oriented Software Development

# COURSE ASSESSMENT PLAN

APPROVED:

## INSTRUCTOR

# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PREVIOUS OFFERING

## Planning to implement

* Releasing the most challenging/recent past exams to help set student expectations
* Finalizing a more sustainable plan for the course website for future instructors to all use
* Try to find ways to require course material presented during the final project to be used in the final project

## Will attempt if there's time

* Getting team assignment and initial design happening before Exam 2
* Possibly getting partners setup on an assignment before the project (and a chance for students to switch)
* Reviewing distribution of assignments to try to better balance the
  workload, eliminating overlapping assignments as possible
* Improving the quality and accessibility of additional resources for greater depth or preparation
* Introduce a survey early during the project about the effectiveness of team communication.

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

Students who successfully complete this course should be able to:

1. Develop software that incorporates the following techniques:
   - Inheritance and class hierarchies
   - Interfaces
   - Polymorphism
   - Casting
   - Exceptions
   - Collections
   - Event-driven graphical user interfaces
   - Exploring and using large-scale API packages (e.g. GUI libraries)
   - Recursion
2. Perform the following steps of the software development cycle effectively:
   - Design expressed as UML class diagrams
   - Documentation before coding
   - Unit and system testing
3. Explain the implementation of linked lists
4. Analyze the asymptotic worst case run time of simple programs.
5. Predict the performance of simple algorithms, including search and
   sort, given their asymptotic worst, best, and average case run
   times.  
6. Select basic data structures (i.e., arrays, linked lists) based on
   asymptotic time complexity of typical operations.
7. Work in a team of 2-4 students on a small-to-medium-size software
   development project including at least three iterative development
   cycles, demonstrating effective:
   - Use of team roles
   - Team decision making
   - Division of labor
   - Conflict resolution

# DESCRIPTION OF ASSESSMENT TOOLS 

Written exercises and small programs: Short thought problems,
mathematical analyses, or design exercises.  Students are also asked
to implement a few of the designs.  Written evaluations of team
members.

Programming assignments: Several programming assignments of varying
size and length.

Exams: 2 exams during the term, plus the final exam

Project: A small-to-medium-size software development project including
at least three iterative development cycles done by teams of 2 and occasionally 3
students
