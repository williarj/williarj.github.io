Just a few notes for graders

# How to checkout student code

[Instructions are here](how_to_grade_a_220_assignment.md)

# How to enter grades

1. Assignments are on Moodle (but you can use the Moodle spreadsheet
   system if you prefer)
2. Don't just rely on unit tests, but don't make yourself crazy
3. Always enter feedback, especially when you take off points
4. Always enter 0s for unsubmitted work (if it's wrong, the student
   will get in contact)

Follow [the grading guidelines](../Docs/grading_guide.md)

# Regrade Requests

1. Initially go through you
2. Be really polite and not aggressive
3. But if anything is weird, immediately escalate via email to the
   professor (and 'cc the student)

# General Guidance

1. Always get paid for all your time, including small breaks and
   working with students
2. Be really nice, but escalate as soon as it gets beyond your pay
   grade
3. Be aware the final 3rd is the worst 3rd in 220
